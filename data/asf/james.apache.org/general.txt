someone had done work ant instead maven i'd lot happier however several our components web sites now built maven so unless we decide ban maven i redo ant both equally unlikely moment making work properly important something can done running mvn ant:ant generates build.xml basic goals something else can done actually using ant plugins doxia can run ant too whole thing does make sense me maven

should junit test dep should derby runtime dep library should ant build tool should any build plugin used should phoenix container should jvm vm my idea we can expect developer already have tools jvm ant maven i also think good have all other things source repository i would try keep them different repository maven repository example we would have dnsjava.jar each product copy james copy jspf maven we can keep single copy library one recent repository related discussions regarding third party dependencies we've talked about repository maintained asf projects containing those artifacts upon which depend under circumstances i might consider trusting repository although still requiring maven fix security issues ok similar solution i proposed you just create maven repository james dependencies source repository project dependencies repository makes sense me apache does thing apache wide imho ok you want us start creating repository james just tell where we should publish i'll try do something imho all stuff good needed reach consensus i'll try work practical matter i'm more concerned about our project builds than web site builds although i'd like able do everything while disconnected you already have all dependencies installed your local repository you're safe asked above how do we ensure i have run least once every command you want run later about maven plugins after while you'll start using maven you have every needed plugin your home m2 folder about project dependencies you can run mvn package you should have anything you need you have all dependencies non maven2 form official download you can mannually install each them your local repository become pita because maven norman tells me although he uses maven build he either manually installs jars checks them hand i tested now delete all my m2 local repository clean checkout our projects i have been able build all without running any mvn install artifacts i uploaded my people.apache.org home have been uploaded very thing working way bug i missed something maybe norman referring manually looking artifacts dependencies plugins when you create pom.xml i don't know we should wait him give us more details btw i still don't get where you add security i bet you never checked jars i uploaded our repository official signed anything i pull down from svn considered trusted because we presume our committers doing right things i would never trust ibiblio have already been instances false artifacts again without signed artifacts nothing should trusted cannot have its origin validated ok i almost share view let's say we trust apache svn repository apache's maven2 repositories committers put stuff like svn order build our products without using codehaus ibiblio we have put artifacts we use from apache.org repository tell me where how i'll do manual work why should you trust things our svn more than things automatically downloaded temporary maven repository i setup people.apache.org current
