sling you create script servlet associate particular resource type selector extension some combination those three so your case you could create script apps myco memo custom.xml.esp request resource rendered script http localhost 8888 tmp memo 12345 custom.xml selection myco memo totally arbitrary you can name whatever you want likewise custom selector can whatever you want 2 setting resource type address child node could helpful consolidating how you generate xml you could create script apps myco address custom.xml.esp use include each address child node i don't think i understand second half your question here some documentation i should reading i've found explain aspect resources me most your questions about post servlet i think answered here http sling.apache.org site manipulating content slingpostservlet servletspost.html said reading though quickly page probably could clearer about how multiple nodes can created from single form post relevance resource types respect scripts here http sling.apache.org site servlets.html i've looked over jcr spec found daunting you can point me sections make sense i'd happy try plough through again section 3.6 really important stuff basic content creation rendering sling you don't really need use jcr api much you do need understand what result any particular http post justin 1 isn't entirely true other ways define resource type other than property 2 strictly speaking you only need selector here you had different xml syntaxes support tony may 24 2010 8 14 pm justin edelson wrote i using sling order management system i would still model tree nodes nodes aren't expensive create although 50 nodes order seems high you're going use jcr you should get used creating nodes when you need create xml documents ingestion other systems that's where sling scripts can come play clear you can do what you doing store xml string properties i said below probably more correct store xml documents nt:file nodes you were storing xhtml docbook files would make sense store document once you start needing parse xml blob your scripts looks like problem me you definitely can do justin 5 24 10 5 00 pm tony giaccone wrote justin i appreciate your help really i do please understand i'm new whole deal trying understand underlying details so maybe little more information would make things clearer xml i'm creating also going used drive external process i can't give explain exact process because other issues you could imagine being analogous order fulfillment system what i'm capturing my node state document created passed off another external service so sense i am fact creating xml document just xml representation document repository xml document record something happened snapshot you might say particular point time xml kind like order we generate xml document drive fulfillment shipping system system going go out act document create it's own copy data drive whole complex system eventually produces order from xml some point future before order gets shipped someone's going look document repository point i'm going take xml document render order summary so we can sure order has been fulfilled about shipped matches what requested now maybe makes sense put document repository sequence resource types maybe reasons would make more sense do i have sense node expensive thing create so idea taking what probably 40 50 elements turning them 40 50 nodes seems excessive me however i'm quite aware my mental model probably flawed when doing development you want play strengths system you using tony may 24 2010 3 11 pm justin

repository i can understand why you wouldn't want write code do can you give me general idea you're going place xml repository you can either do what you doing using nt:file node i think both wrong based your description general case however you have file you should use nt:file see http wiki.apache.org jackrabbit davidsmodel rule_ 236 _files_are_files_are_files i just don't think you have file you have structured data structured data should saved nodes properties perhaps i'm misunderstanding your situation when you talk about creating xml representation raises big red flags me parsing xml document jsp you can obviously do inline java jaxp you were using esp you could probably use e4x api i've tested personally i have xml document how do i put repository correct manner doesn't sound me like you do have xml document you have document which you generate xml representation i'm suggesting you think mapping between document jcr nodes instead creating xml representation example let's say your document memo which has from address address date body each address actually composed first name last name i would create single jcr node properties date body child nodes named from each which having properties named firstname lastname you could do single form post namevaluepair formdata new namevaluepair from firstname justin new namevaluepair from lastname edelson new namevaluepair from sling:resourcetype myco address new namevaluepair firstname tony new namevaluepair lastname giaccone new namevaluepair sling:resourcetype myco address new namevaluepair date some date new

your own script customize xml generated justin tony may 24 2010 1 08 pm justin edelson wrote just doesn't make sense me take object document create xml representation object store representation repository single node node property you have document name firstname bob firstname lastname smith lastname name document currently you're storing document documents doc1 documents doc1 name firstname bob documents doc1 name lastname smith i.e doc1 has child node called name which has attributes named firstname lastname you store xml repository want access values inside document script you'll need

sling.apache.org_users_201103_30 i managed figure out why weblogic serializing session objects has nothing do sling jsps servlets its little strange documented anywhere weblogic documentation explanation follows two web applications need share classes session objects two ways do first package both web applications ear either 1 have shared classes jar placed app inf lib directory 2 have shared classes common place say lib directory ear level each war have class path attribute meta inf manifesh.mf which explicitly lists jar file approach 2 where serialization happens when you have class path manifest.mf classes still loaded war class loader both web applications sharing session objects refering classes referred manifest.mf you should ideally getting classcastexception happens classes do implement serializable behaviour very different classes used session objects implementing serializable weblogic seems serialize deserialize objects session whenever session.getattribute called makes possible have classes loaded separate war classloaders still possible share session objects we have cq packaged web application ear we need have class path entry manifest.mf file launchpad.war refer shared jars whenever you access session objects sling objects serialized deserialized again resolved classes sling bundle class space so approach share classes session sling other web application following 1 package cq sling web application existing ear 2 deploy system.bundle extension fragment exporting all packages you need access cq 3 weblogic two ways share classes put all shared jars app inf lib directory ear approach you do need class path entries manifest.mf classes loaded ear classloader b put jars some common lib ear say ear lib all web applications have class path entry manifest.mf list jars ear lib make sure all classes shared jars serializable update manifest.mf launchpad.war have same class path entries now whenever you access session object request.getsession getattribute object serialized deserialized again while deserialzing resolve class launchpad's classloader i prefer app inf lib approach manifest.mf later adding unnecessary overhead serialization deserialization session sharing within same jvm i am sure why people have used approach j2ee 5 addition library element application.xml ear which allows you define ear level library much cleaner than above two approaches hope helps thanks unmesh thanks unmesh fri mar 4 2011 5 07 pm alexander klimetschek aklimets adobe.com wrote 03.03.11 19 47 unmesh joshi unmeshjoshi gmail.com wrote actual deserialization going happens only when session.getattribute called from jsp sling its called from slingservlet which osgi bundle doesn't happen we do need serialization all sure why kind thing happening only when called from jsp running sling ok sounds bit weird how does stack trace when debugging look like you call session.getattribute from servlet sling regards alex alexander klimetschek developer adobe day berlin basel

sling.apache.org_users_201101_3 however i have seen code top some jsps typical controller e.g checking whether user logged has appropriate role redirecting that's case authentication so generic required most web apps generally handled sling also jcr repository general concept have authentication authorization part repository infrastructure so when sling provides jcr session each request must log given user details how certain auth mechanisms works http basic form login openid etc can plugged authentication handlers more see http sling.apache.org site authentication.html yet i found code sample crx bookstore application http code.google.com p crxzon source browse trunk apps bookstore components checkout checkout.jsp r 11 authentication only reason controling view i guess everything that's static resource lookup dynamic runtime decision benefits from having controller e.g onlineshop where user enters his address software might check address redirect user different payment flows depending location can cleanly expressed sling i would like see code controller long before my html view template about render mixed my view any concept sling provide better separation speaking about separation i have seen lot code top esp jsps files that's fine samples last years i always tried avoid kind mixture my projects way provide all code java services which can make use di just provide calculated values html view something i'd do normally controller i am aware jsps taglibs hm i don't like programming model any alternatives i think all aspect maximizing code reuse code readability rendition view layer access model comes jcr api using node your flexible domain object resource api sling just simpler api abstraction top can already lead short jsps e.g just printing properties node extracting more complex code i would use helper classes wrapper objects wrapping jcr resource api yes even write custom tag lib jsp specific though probably only very common things i think wrong those things placed inside web application controller either part model here mainly jcr simply helpers rendering logic might also philosophical question things like simple helpers e.g slingbucks example price calculated esp fine example real world app you would probably have ask other systems sales conditions make db lookup check blacklists etc soon calculation longer simple you want have access your ecosystem probably services dependency injection ease wiring that's nothing simple static helper tag library has offer it's much easier do all java based controller i know spring mvc world people write lot domain objects restrict people use only what provide jsps sling jcr however underlying data model much more flexible because unstructured thus allows faster development cycles less layers code maintain also rule jsp snippets which imho totally arbitrary comes from wrong notion only web designers work jsps should messing code many cases you have very rendering specific logic why use all what jsp technology provides first place mhm because it's too easy produce hard test maintenance nightmare unfortunately i had develop rather large site where jsps heavily mixed markup code had multi level snippet includes while system originally developed very short time frame maintenance extremely painful expensive 2 how input validation done postservlet allows client post nearly everything every structure repository i am sure ways restrict ability i guess part define acls repository use nt:unstructured nodetype more precise one see next question how would i do more low level validation like checking number certain range string matches given regex given e mailadress already existent repository sling post processors way combine post servlet run after sling post operation has been executed current jcr session before has been saved http sling.apache.org apidocs sling5 org apache sling servlets post sling postprocessor.html use custom filter runs before sling post servlet otherwise most cases validation can must also already happen ui side combination unstructured gives you best flexibility while providing good experience users don't afraid using nt:unstructured most cases you don't want hard constrains repository you start using strongly constrained node types fixed schema you loose lot niceness jcr regard also have look david's model http wiki.apache.org

doors open attackers put malicious content so input validation must that's where i would hope get some help from my model model already knows property string number can help me check input maybe it's possible add validation rules nodetype so input validation done declaratively that's possible unstructured nodetype mhm i am sure i really see advantages nt:unstructured model exists either code duck

sling.apache.org_users_201101_5 hi i am evaluating cq5 sling have 2 questions freemarker support any questions should addressed other mailing list please don't hesitate point sling freemarker scripting engine binds some objects like current node freemarker model map executes ftl template feeding model that's fine since freemarker support based scripting engine all freemarker request routed through single class i.e freemarkerscriptengine i find approach little bit limited i am much more old school freemarker usage create sling servlet handles specific request url like http foo.bar app productlist let servlet build model load freemarker template send freemarker template processing result outputstream code looks like code class myproductslingservlet extends slingsafemethodsservlet public void doget slinghttpservletrequest request slinghttpservletresponse response map model buildspecificmodel request template freemarkertemplate gettemplate request freemarkertemplate.process model response.getwriter code make work i had deploy osgified freemarker felix employing approach i can write servlet can build specific model specific request so building model choosing appropriate ftl file nicely encapsulated servlet created handle given request major difference how works sling freemarker scripting since latter only binds current node freemarker map asfaik behavior can extended using mechanism allow bundles contribute script binding values indeed i can see dedicated building model per request mechanism any comments from more experienced cq5 sling users other thing i bumped fact freemarker scripting support sling osgi bundle org.apache.sling.scripting.freemarker freemarker embedded why done like isn't more natural correct have bundle contains only it's own classes specify imports freemarker.template package.it would require installing 2 bundles osgified freemarker freemarker scripting support bundle final solution would more osgi friendly matter face today i did some sample coding wanted extend code presented above putting current node object model map looking http svn.apache.org viewvc sling trunk contrib scripting freemarker src main java org apache sling scripting freemarker freemarkerscriptengine.java view markupit seemed quite simple code resource resource request.getresource node n resource.adaptto node.class model.put currentnode new nodemodel n code everything seemed work fine i able reach currentnode variable its properties from my ftl file problem instead getting string values properties i did get strings like org.apache.sling.scripting.freemarker.wrapper.propertymodel 1fsa2 100 wasn't value property i referenced looked me like result tostring call org.apache.sling.scripting.freemarker.wrapper.propertymodel instance after short investigation i found out problem caused 2 version freemarker system one i installed myself use freemarker my sling servlet second one from freemarker scripting support since freemarker processing triggered my sling servlet all template building processing done context my own installed osgified version freemarker nodemodel any its child rendered returns instances reference implement freemarker classes unfortunately classes were loaded from freemarker scripting support bundle hence different classloader from one processes ftl template so property values couldn't correctly rendered solution straightforward just remove embedded freemarker from freemarker scripting support bundle let bundle import osgified freemarker i believe bug freemarker embedded freemarker scripting support bundle should removed asap regards miluch
