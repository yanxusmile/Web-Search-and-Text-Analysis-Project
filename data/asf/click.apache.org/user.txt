click.apache.org_user_200812_13 any way retrieve label selected option from select select.getvalue returns value selected option select.getlabel returns label select label option i think correct so each click control has label displayed tag near field select consists option tags can more than one selected option so you basically want label option case selected one string foundvalue myselect.getvalue you don't have reference model where you created list alloptions myselect.getoptionlist option option alloptions option.getvalue equals foundvalue system.out.println found label option.getlabel you need all time label options than simpler use new option label way value label same so select getvalue return what you need demetrios

click.apache.org_user_201009_8 thank you very much your your detailed example i'm 100 sure what you're looking solves simple example i used illustrate problem unfortunately doesn't seem solve problem problem still remains two possible paths 1 decorate page like sitemesh keep click features 2 have several insertion points somehow 1 i haven't found way do click keep it's features e.g perforance filter versioning resources automatic insert required dependencies i used sitemesh many other dumb frameworks quite simply 2 seems arise from discrepancy between java page template page inheritance behavior i.e java page can extended often one wishes corresponding htm templates have inheritance just one level parse path trick most important would override behavior course isn't fault click since velocity templates don't support inheritance like django 1 looks simpler achieve i guess shouldn't impossible achieve either although i have only one vague idea how maybe velocity devs have better idea e.g class borderpage extends page edituserpage extends borderpage void build form form addbutton.setinsertion point_2 moreuserpage extends edituserpage void build form form morebutton.setinsertion point_3 border template could look like border template.htm html div point_1 default div div other stuff div div point_2 div div other stuff div div point_n div html edit user.htm form addbutton more user.htm form morebutton form would added default insertion point so extra api call would required however since would same point later one moreuser.java would override way only java also tempalte morebutton other hand wouldn't override since would use point_3 well i guess template inheritance would more flexible sitemesh approach seems simpler regards andrei

click.apache.org_user_200906_40 hi again bob i've been thinking lot about over weekend so far all solutions i can think make things happen automatically somewhat complex error prone i keep coming back very simple solution just including necessary css js required control question e.g plain click table header initial page since initial page reloaded during ajax interaction since cssimports jsimports do appear template fragments returned ajax calls imports included exactly once upside it's very simple solution downside you'd need maintain list necessary css js imports your base layout according all controls could possibly appear your user navigates throughout pages your application let me know you have more thoughts thanks freddy

click.apache.org_user_200904_1 i’d suggest you use firebug firefox you already would tell you why your js doesn’t work second case you describe below where you embed js html when accessing page directly inside modal dialog does your js work ok muzaffer from jacob wills mailto:jacob.wills gmail.com sent thursday april 02 2009 11 17 am click user incubator.apache.org subject ajax javascript jquery hi i'm having problems getting javascript run properly pages i load jquery's load function i have modal window i want populate click page so i use load grab its template htm file click's automapping runs associated java class problem any controls page use javascript like click calendar's calendarfield don't work since external js files aren't being passed along everything else css transfers just fine jsimports always empty when i tried make use gethtmlimports i found isn't even being called during process even i try hack around things include js files container's page controls within ajax'ed page still won't work way make work am i going about wrong way would clickclick's jquery controls make things any simpler thanks jacob wills
click.apache.org_user_200904_2 hi jacob jacob wills wrote problem any controls page use javascript like click calendar's calendarfield don't work since external js files aren't being passed along everything else css transfers just fine jsimports always empty when i tried make use gethtmlimports i found isn't even being called during process so cssimports populated jsimports strange because both variables set processed same time even i try hack around things include js files container's page controls within ajax'ed page still won't work some click controls calendarfield makes use addloadevent function script control.js addloadevent fired when page dom ready which similar jquery's ready function other words component calendarfield can register itself receive callback when dom ready what might happening here ajax call made after page dom ready thus when calendarfield registers itself addloadevent never receives callback because dom ready event fired again workaround you can try add following javascript script snippet your container page typeof click undefined script.append typeof click.domready undefined script.append click.domready.ready true above snippet programmatically set ready variable true so when calendarfield registers itself addloadevent its callback should occur immediately let us know works kind regards bob

click.apache.org_user_200910_22 hi doychi i've never used jpa before have little hibernate experience now sure you're using jpa through hibernate different implementation anyway error you receive indicates session entitymanager closed somewhere lower layer your app time view needs iterate over roles my spring hibernate little rusty i think following happening your repository contains annotation transactional its spring construct which means i recall invoking any method repository create new transaction before method starts commit transaction before method returns depending how you configured your spring.xml might mean session entitymanager closed when transaction committed how do you configure spring create transactions entitymanager can you post here you might want look openentitymanagerinviewfilter which opens entitymanager when request arrives keeps open until request finishes thus entitymanager open your view lazy initialization won't occur alternatively you need

click.apache.org_user_200907_48 hi bala balachandra maddina wrote hi when i going through examples i noticed control.js extras control.js being added ui i dont think script minified does affect performance anyway its okay have click does minify scripts runtime thats what you mean minified script can save bit bandwidth though example running control.js through jsmin saves up 40 so control.js shrinks from 10kb 6kb however you use performancefilter javascript css files gzipped far future expiry header set so cached browser only downloaded once answer your original question bit hard because depends how much traffic site have average site i would say yes affects bandwidth i don't think you need worry about especially click fronted performancefilter btw i believe bigger performance gain had minifying scripts rather combining scripts one since browsers default only make two connections time more resources downloaded slower site loads you already using i suggest you look yslow its quite useful tool grade your site performance kind regards bob

click.apache.org_user_201002_12 hi guys i'd like restart discussion whether should possible able change column attributes from within decorator i've been playing around jquery lot lately i think would great i could set columns class from java inside decorator based it's value some other displayed value object course changes shouldn't change signature which would break existing code i think my draft columndecorator would good solution kind regards sven zitat von sven pfeiffer sven.pfeiffer madsep.de i've been thinking about too possible solution won't have any impact existing apps would create abstract class columndecorator like public abstract class columndecorator implements decorator private column column public column getcolumn return column public void setcolumn column column this.column column public abstract string render object object context context you could check column has columndecorator set call setter bob schellink wrote i think might problem we change signature decorator break existing applications decorator used tree propertyselect well have think bit how we can introduce attribute manipulation cell level without impacting existing apps kind regards bob sven.pfeiffer madsep.de wrote i am wondering would nice decorator has capability change column style i guess would quite easy decorator would have reference column b content which rendered decorator must processed before column itself rendered rendering adding htmlstringbuffer could done rendertabledatacontent called beginning rendertabledata storing result rendertabledatacontent string before putting buffer you think good idea i could create patch open jira issue change zitat von bob schellink sabob1 gmail.com custom column least method column rendertabledata would have adapted add attributes per cell basis kind regards bob malcolm edgar wrote hi sven subclass table do regards malcol you probably need m edgar thu dec 10 2009 10 56 am sven.pfeiffer madsep.de wrote hi list i'd like change background color table row depending value displayed table i am showing table one row each day current month highlight weekends saturdays sundays should have different background color usually i am using decorator handling value objects i don't see way how change background color table cells way do thanks advance sven

your case you add fields form over multiple ajax requests form representation browser very different from form representation server thus when you finally submit form fields added ajax won't have corresponding field server form values won't bound remedy you probably want switch stateful pages however simple flip switch setting stateless vs stateful take different approaches stateful mode page

things working feel free post your code list i'll help where i can one note about clickclick's ajaxadapter you won't have change much your code use ajaxadapter since supports both ajax non ajax calls so your code looks like public class mypage extends page public void oninit submit submit new submit submit onsubmitclick public boolean onsubmitclick dostuff return true change public class mypage

ajaxtestpopulate right looking ajaxtestpopulate problem seems use autobinding i recommend using autobinding feature you new click quite bit magic involved which can confusing just explain what i think goes wrong autobinding example 1 click creates ajaxtestpopulate page invoking its default arg constructor 2 immediately after creating page click binds all public declared fields page follows 2.1 click checks field null 2.2 field null its name set click sets control name field 2.3 lastly click adds control page control list problem ajaxtestpopulate after page constructor called childlist still null since only created onget page event you can change page follows public class ajaxtestpopulate extends page public checklist childlist public ajaxtestpopulate create childlist page constructor when autobinding kicks off after page construction childlist control created satisfy 2.1 above childlist getchildlist alternatively you can use explicit binding public class ajaxtestpopulate extends

working me we cannot create controls main page constructor since those dynamically created based user selection because limitation i make page stateful next time oninit method called e.g when submit

however i don't see control server side page bob has explained below it's because server aware render happened client question getting handle form page adding control b1 form only way make server aware new control added basically yes you either have access form from stateful page place form directly httpsession access from any other way do basically we going add control b1 o page a's form object whole form being sent back from client browser server right i am wondering way have send whole form back forth from client browser technically doesn't seem possible me i am so clear about all sending back whole form probably easiest because form include all markup render controls you can send back only field fields fieldset you added need render whole form you can use your js library

lost you navigate table first time you need either use stateful page setstateful true page constructor do some footwork url parameters continue use stateless page you need pass choices made your lists url parameters back page when you set district when you navigate table i'd use client side library jquery capture values select objects append values previous next table navigation urls when back page you must use those values re configure your lists state district schools sounds like lot work go stateful page jay wang wrote hi i have page where i let user select state from selection list 50 states

click.apache.org_user_200909_26 sorry late reply road map make click little rest friendly doput dodelete don't seem implemented clickservlet judging from rails rest approach seems greatly simplify many applications isn't rest targeted services rather than front end practice i see mostly services provided web applications almost all well known rails based applications have rest ui also allows 3rd parties use those pages services automation integration without extra effort form provider side i can see how action based framework might find benefits from rest really component oriented ones i look more those rails apps i see has nothing do inner architecture web framework action component based how user application see can use manually automated fact many users don't even know difference e.g just use ready made batch script curl add hundreds customers like example delete customer one would most like add event listener button instead overriding ondelete event i don't mean click ondelete event servlet dodelete method internally might well possible would trigger click's delete event listener what makes more sense idea just support those http put delete operations would interesting hear what benefits rest would bring users click application pages restful urls would ui api too zero effort from developer's side regards andrei
