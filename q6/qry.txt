abdera.apache.org_user_200903_0 although looks like list has grown pretty cold many thanks bryon charles answering quickly my question about abdera extensions few weeks ago that's now working perfectly me i have another question now thought i'd try going back well one extensions we're using add via attribute category item that's easy do using abdera api follows feed feed abdera.newfeed category cat feed.addcategory term_value cat.setattributevalue via via_value when writing out document xml works perfectly example two category items xml might look like category term 4500 via author category term sonicnoaa via user that's exactly what i need i now need also provide same atom document json instead xml fortunately abdera includes very nice json conversion handles most extensions particularly those namespaces well seems ignore added xml attributes abdera generated json same document produced xml above produces json categories term 4500 term sonicnoaa i.e via attribute has been lost since using feed.writeto generate xml produces desired result i have some confidence my atom document some sense correct when writing same atom document json instead xml loses via attribute seems json writer incomplete so i have three questions 1 something could fixed using current version abdera differently 2 something could fixed hacking abdera source more general question 3 just what status abdera looks like got promoted top level apache project november 2008 froze version 0.4 progressing thanks johnny tolliver tolliver ornl.gov 865 574 1305

shale.apache.org_user_200903_1 hi ryan primary reason lock down what made up sub component tree after built first time component builds all its children first rendering state management reasons you have make sure component has same shape postback especially important when uidata family component where only one instance component model enumerated underneath we would need store subtrees off private facet we wanted start supporting polymorphic subtrees displayelementobject should same instance memory templateconfigbean uses you guys still using clay you starting migrate facets gary original message from ryan wynn ryan.m.wynn gmail.com user shale.apache.org sent monday march 16 2009 3 25 38 pm gmt 07 00 us canada mountain subject clay state question i noticed clay component saves displayelementobject state savestate would seem me would cause some unnecessary overhead terms space when using server side state management since displayelement root already being cached globally templateconfigbean would valid optimization have clay component retrieve from instead caching part component state any reason why needs saved component state thanks ryan
