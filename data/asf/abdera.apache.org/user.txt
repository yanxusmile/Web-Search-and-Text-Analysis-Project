abdera.apache.org_user_200903_0 although looks like list has grown pretty cold many thanks bryon charles answering quickly my question about abdera extensions few weeks ago that's now working perfectly me i have another question now thought i'd try going back well one extensions we're using add via attribute category item that's easy do using abdera api follows feed feed abdera.newfeed category cat feed.addcategory term_value cat.setattributevalue via via_value when writing out document xml works perfectly example two category items xml might look like category term 4500 via author category term sonicnoaa via user that's exactly what i need i now need also provide same atom document json instead xml fortunately abdera includes very nice json conversion handles most extensions particularly those namespaces well seems ignore added xml attributes abdera generated json same document produced xml above produces json categories term 4500 term sonicnoaa i.e via attribute has been lost since using feed.writeto generate xml produces desired result i have some confidence my atom document some sense correct when writing same atom document json instead xml loses via attribute seems json writer incomplete so i have three questions 1 something could fixed using current version abdera differently 2 something could fixed hacking abdera source more general question 3 just what status abdera looks like got promoted top level apache project november 2008 froze version 0.4 progressing thanks johnny tolliver tolliver ornl.gov 865 574 1305
abdera.apache.org_user_200903_1 hi firstly let me say uritemplate impl great works great us recently i came across issue neg operator which seems deviates from spec spec states following http bitworking.org projects uri templates spec draft gregorio uritemplate 02 txt 3.3.2 neg operator all variables un defined empty substitute value arg otherwise substitute empty string template t new template http cnn.com neg all foo bar map m new hashmap m.put foo value string out t.expand m out http cnn.com all note output returns all inspite one variables being declared i read correctly should return http cnn.com instead http cnn.com all can you please confirm bug point me correct spec after debugging bit looks like can fixed following diff i'm looking sources from abdera i18n 1.0 20090105.215721 1 sources.jar org apache abdera i18n templates operation.java 2008 12 19 12 54 26.000000000 0800 patch operation.java 2009 03 25 17 39 18.000000000 0700 528,9 528,9 public string evaluate string var string arg context context string vardefs var.split s s string v vardefs isdefined v context return arg isdefined v context return null return null return arg public void explain string var string arg appendable buf throws ioexception buf.append let me know you'd like me file bug thanks nagesh

abdera.apache.org_user_200807_24 hi i'm finally getting chance try out atompub anger we have cms backed jcr we need expose remote api cms atompub seems like reasonable first choice our initial requirement able create new media entries update entries reference new media entries i've spent day reading docs code trying out few ideas now i have few questions our first iteration needs support something like functionality below please feel free point out where i'm going wrong i'm using abdera trunk from jira commits looks where development happening rather than branch i'm envisaging uris something like 1 https example.com atom get return service document basic auth used identify client service document representation vary depending authorization allowed each account i.e which workspaces have access my application 1 1 correlation between atompub workspaces jcr workspaces i have serving service document currently albeit within implementing any security requirements 2 https example.com atom workspace collection get return collection feed which probably pagable via http tools.ietf.org html rfc5005 we might also require opensearch later date post create new items collection we allow creation media resource entry resources control path item within jcr we're thinking using slug header defining semantics header within our server mean absolute path within jcr node uuid within jcr bad 3 https example.com atom workspace collection id get retrieve entry put update entry delete remove entry blah i think i have reasonable high level understanding atompub i've also read sam ruby leonard richardson's book i did consider rolling our own restful api i hoping atompub would more standardised thus hopefully less work other clients work initial use case create new binary items example what i'm trying do we have different types content cms which i'll probably expose least collection each type content one types might images since our application works mobile has cater wide variety user agent capabilities we define image content type capable having zero many image files associated so we have instance image content type say picture atom powered robot has many different representations same resource 120 80 jpg 120 80 png 150 100 gif etc we have another system spits out different representations give single master image system would like able update cms uploading new representations become available so initially entry atom powered robot image might look like entry xmlns http www.w3 org 2005 atom title atom powered robots run amok title id urn:uuid 1225c695 cfb8 4ebb aaaa 80da344efa6a id updated 2003 12 13t18 30 02z updated author name john doe name author content some text content link rel edit media href https example.com atom workspace images atom powered robot.jpg link rel edit href https example.com atom workspace images atom powered robot id a:properties xmlns:a http example.com xmlns 2008 07 pub media:group xmlns:media http search.yahoo.com mrss media:content url https example.com atom workspace images atom powered robot.jpg filesize 12216 type image jpeg height 200 width 300 media:group a:properties entry so my understanding atompub means i need post binary say png version collection create new media resource media link entry wrong me define side effect operation mean also altering atom powered robot image entry have new link rel edit link rel edit media should i require explicit get put entry cause update happen should i maybe expose collection each content item can contain collection different representations i thought about some them can contain multiple collections so where's cut off point approach api questions i mentioned above i have service document working some degree i'm little uncomfortable about classes imp package i've used get working though what's preferred way feedback potential points where maybe api should altered make obvious what extend what considered published uri mapping i don't know rails i know django so routemanager looks intriguing i'm currently using regextargetresolver uris i've outlined about better way me managing aspect my implementation sorry it's essay cheers james

demo aligns spring philosophy coding interfaces hierarchicaldependencyconstraint used jdepend library my unit test jdepend comes constraint class can validate dependencies however you have explicitly

abdera.apache.org_user_200803_10 hi dan thanks answering me i just took look activemq restful queue link you sent i didn't know had feature nice know however approach doesn't really match my goals i posted some time ago regarding idea using atom feed enterprise messaging you can see post here you'd like http blpsilva.wordpress.com 2008 01 27 atom feeds enterprise application messaging basic idea like following suppose you have given application doing some things other applications must notified about example let's say application responsible google's users registration called register each user's registration event register app now let's consider youtube picasa gmail applications interested events let's suppose when new user created he must have his gmail mailbox created his filesystem directory created picasa youtube one event register application generates events several other applications you could possibly add other applications notified whenever you want order have nice solution low coupling i thought using atom feed represent list created users any application needs do something when new user created can simply subscribe feed do whatever needs when new entry created currently i'm developing several asynchronous processes would make use queues replace synchronous processing we'll have maybe several hundred threads consuming queue order make queue processing very fast course i could put queue database use some classic transactional way reading avoid problems however i could use atom feed i'd really like design would cleaner it'd convenient our restful architecture i just saw your response your post about mule's jersey connector i'll take look http polling component you mentioned once i have chosen given option i'll reply here thanks help regards bruno luiz pereira da silva blpsilva gmail.com http brunopereira.com.br tue mar 11 2008 9 16 pm dan diephouse dan.diephouse mulesource.com wrote there's been some good discussion about how do type thing past activemq implements restful interface via per consumer queues http activemq.apache.org restful queue.html there's also good thread how do queueing scenarios restfully here http tech.groups.yahoo.com group rest discuss message 8955 per consumer subscription probably sanest way do atom without introducing application specific semantics dan p.s i just realized i never replied your blog comment i'll do now bruno luiz pereira da silva wrote hi i'd like ask you guys about something i'm considering use project we developing several asynchronous processes here we populate queue items processed queue consumed lots let's say 100 200 simultaneous threads process items upon completion processor publish another queue successfully processed items i'm considering use atom feeds both queues item processed would published entry processed feed after being successfully processed item would published item successfully processed feed order avoid 2 different batch instances processing same item from processed feed i thought using etag manage batch instance trying get item process would try update given element entry informing etag item batch instance able update element it'll process item publish entry successfully processed feed everything goes well processing i'd like know you guys think atom feeds adequate do just good idea i don't know atom feeds can handle well several threads trying update something same time i'll appreciate your thoughts comments dan diephouse mulesource http mulesource.com http netzooid.com

abdera.apache.org_user_200808_12 hi i just started work abdera 0.4.0 after finding out hard way has fairly central bug https issues.apache.org jira browse abdera 167 now works beautifully now i want use abdera produce news feed where users can subscribe different categories news i've seen atom spec feeds entries can categorized i've seen one can specify patterns categories document targetresolver unfortunately i'm missing big picture how supposed work out end haven't been able find any abdera docs can somebody give me some pointers can i implement multiple categories one abstractentitycollectionadapter where does get its category from parametrize its entity query does multiple categories automatically mean multiple feeds any magic going abdera auto magically creates category documents when entries categorized thanks any help helpful hints also any plan prepare new release fixes above mentioned bug good idea use full abdera servlet setup generating feeds meant more instructional example other words would better practice only use abdera produce xml serve other means some highlevel mission statement would help have i overlooked something thanks jörg

abdera.apache.org_user_200805_6 sure i can file jira frustrating thing special test case repro i'm simply doing following steps case from groovy def abdera new abdera entry entry abdera.newentry when i run idea calling from unit test executing custom ant task works fine when i'm calling from inside custom ant task running command line i get null pointer exceptions i've described supports notion being race condition it's highly squirrelly environment specific sorry some my characters email below got little munged entourage email client i'm stuck using moment awful i never thought i would miss

been able investigate tomorrow i should available afternoon look over try get fixed you haven't done so already please file issue jira would also helpful you could provide describe test case so i can reproduce error verify fix james todd wells wrote unfortunately problem getting worse i think i know fundamental problem see below i went halfway down roll my own route i grabbed xml via http parsed myself manually created abdera entry order keep much my code unchanged possible alas another nullpointerexception time when i call abdera.newentry caused java.lang.nullpointerexception org.apache.abdera.abdera.newentry abdera.java 114 code line very simple return getfactory newentry so means getfactory returning null indicating abdera class also possible use getfactory before factory initialized exactly analogous getparser where other npe thrown rate i'm going need rip out all my abdera dependent code looking code i m pretty sure i know what s happening constructor abdera allowing reference escape during construction constructor abdera calls out newfactory newparser etc those methods calls other methods passing argument since constructor hasn t finished executing yet only partially constructed object point methods refer so integrity object can t guaranteed i followed one those code paths down rabbit hole discovered classloader gets involved some point so you probably have thread accessing abdera object before s fully constructed more detailed explanation see section 3.2.1 brian goetz s book java concurrency practice where he explicitly warns against error actually googling i see he had earlier article discusses same issue http www.ibm.com developerworks java library j jtp0618 html may just speed my machine jvm implementation 2 x 2.8 ghz quad core xeon running os x causing npe come up scenario fact escaping during construction problem probably cause other people grief down road 4 29 08 2 58 pm james m snell jasnell gmail.com wrote i haven't yet had opportunity look today hoping able look later evening james todd wells wrote i haven't heard any more feedback since classpaths appear identical practical purposes do you think my supposition race

4 21 pm todd wells todd.wells theplatform.com wrote you bet what it's worth i changed my maven dependency abdera 0.3.0 had same problem i am suspecting race condition some sort because analyzing line 96 abstractclientresponse w here nullpointerexception thrown seems like s probably calling parser getdefaultparseroptions before parser initialized so s trying call getdefaultparseroptions null object seems abdera using parser multi threaded fashion since getparser method synchronized so i m suspecting race condition between threads somewhere where i m actually managing call getdocument before parser initialized i wrote little code munge classpaths command line vs idea said idea has following things classpath ant doesn't system library frameworks javavm.framework versions 1.5 home classes c

abdera.apache.org_user_200805_24 greetings some you aware over past year we have developed generic atompub data services layer top abdera our employer has now graciously allowed us release open source project available http www.atomserver.org we were really hoping get out before recent discussion server refactoring so we could join just point everyone actual code timing did work out so please bear long winded email appears really too large difference between our code structure current server refactoring although names our objects course different least arguably more clear end user some primary tenents our design include object model which reflects atom data model atom has concepts service workspace collection entry where each has implied interface service contains set one more workspaces delegates operations them workspace has set zero more collections further delegates operations them collections set zero more entries which represented both generic metadata e.g updated published id etc some entry specific content which essentially undefined important note object model which reflects hierarchy conceptually natural end user content real touch point client almost every other aspect atom server can handled them so each client does have reinvent wheel system contains numerous extension points when defaults do meet needs client design must support configuration points we call workspaceoptions collectionoptions consumed create real world counterparts configuring workspaces collections directly problematic quite simply because we cannot omniscient all possible client options providing level indirection here yields significantly more flexible design fits better ioc systems other words end user configures workspaceoptions which consumed produce workspaces etc said we have built relatively full featured atom server production has been battle hardened ton traffic currently servicing 1m hits day our atom server acts data bus between our many disparate sites allowing them easily share information i emphasize stress point model presented below result many iterations several real world clients approach we have taken clearly separate entry content from atom metadata itself provide off shelf solution our atomserver takes responsibility managing all atom metadata workspaces collections entries client responsible only storing content general we've also made even transparent them since mostly storing xml either files clobs db so most purposes creating atomserver simply exercise configuration i.e spring atom metadata managed relational database using ibatis yield database neutrality we currently support hsqldb postgresql sqlserver support other databases planned our database interaction our schema queries we run has gone through several iterations guarantees transactional correctness can handle handle high loads large datasets our atomserver implements atompub spec using abdera hence post here has extensions largely based gdata although we have made few small usability tweaks based client feedback current feature set includes among others support optimistic concurrency overrides single writer schemes full support consistent paging full category support including support complex boolean category queries auto tagging support workspaces collections can configured categories automatically created when entries created updated when content xml can done using xpath plug gable content validation support emphasis relax ng xsd support planned plug gable content storage aggregate support workspaces collections can configured aggregates other entries directly addressable full support batch operations optional locale sensitivity entries digging design top level class atomserver you would expect extends abdera's

abdera.apache.org_user_200805_28 fwiw my feeling abdera should attempt stay application neutral focus being atompub framework upon which applications built does seem best interest abdera stray too deeply application server space example rather than attempt shoehorn all possible extensions paging etc abdera should mostly does focus providing generic extensibility similarly abdera should avoid being specific about metadata content storage abdera does decent job today provider concept although targetresolver approach somewhat problematic noting we still 0.3.0 way i feel abdera reach much wider audience have more profound effect overall i do say because we've built atom server outside abdera i say because design decisions made when building framework often widely different than those made building applications justifiably so thus i'm also unclear where atomserver.org abdera could share code although i do definitely see sharing possibilities work y'all google contributing which many ways pretty similar atomserver abdera proper i think abdera might consider arguably more clear server interface structure atomserver more natural fit atompub metaphor regardless long abdera maintains extensibility provider level maintains its focus below remains extensible more application agnostic way finally i could agree more looking atompub content neutral wrapper incredibly powerful we have been amazed how successful idea atom store has worked us particular atom categories largely responsible success providing ability enrich data without messing raw data itself system becomes much more than sum its parts fact we've found atom store idea so successful we sometimes wonder we're seeing whole world nail our atompub hammer cheers chris may 30 2008 11 29 am david primmer wrote

abdera.apache.org_user_200702_3 well time being my problem seems solved definitely make test case demonstrate problem now right now i am gunpoint complete work you interested get overview pbm how i solved continue reading my app server has two media collections code copy media entries from one collection another media collection each media entry algorithm i use 1 get media link entry from coll1 2 extract edit media link from media link entry 3 make urlconnection edit media link which arbitrary file 4 get inputstream from urlconnection pass abdera client along coll2 url post server 5 server returns media link entry newly created resource coll2 6 client updates summary title etc makes put media link entry edit url note file buffered before posting new collection step 6 when client updates summary title also updates author information right now server does support authentication code looks like medialinkentry.addauthor config.getusername medialinkentry.setsummary summary inspite config.getusername returning proper string yogesh my case author element added entry funny part i put breakpoint setsummary check value medialinkentry eclipse shows author element i dont put breakpoint though code executes author element added my server throws exceptions immediately after server throws exception i again make get request any collection client goes infinite wait problem server so two problems here 1 author element getting added 2 client going wait state how i have temporarily solved after step 3 file buffered locally inputstream buffered file given abdera client along coll2 url post server server stores file returns media link entry newly created resource add another medialinkentry.addauthor config.getusername after setsummary called now code looks like medialinkentry.addauthor config.getusername medialinkentry.setsummary summary medialinkentry.addauthor config.getusername works author element added wait state pbm i dunno how why ugo you suggested i have added release call after every request i am still sure solution need test more 2 2 07 ugo cei ugo.cei gmail.com wrote feb 1 2007 10 02 pm yogesh mujumdar wrote sometimes after executing post i execute get client goes infinite wait state when digged down actual wait multithreadedhttpconnectionmanager somewhere line number 509 i guess i feel problem connection pool any way set size 1 any way have single threaded http connection manager i know relevant question ask here since i am facing pbm while using abdera i am taking liberty ask i am struck here from past 3 days gave up today please help me call release clientresponse object you get from every request you do ugo ugo cei blog http agylen.com open source zone http oszone.org evil http evilornot.info company http www.sourcesense.com regards yogesh

abdera.apache.org_user_200804_21 something very similar routemanager.resolve returns target object ca i suppose i can just lift code now i understand why still finds ca when last collectionadapter argument left off defaultprovider's route specifications thanks davep tue apr 15 2008 7 58 pm james m snell jasnell gmail.com wrote customprovider example only supports single adapter abstractworkspaceprovider can provide many necessary overriding getcollectionadapter requestcontext method i have current implementation using subclass awp returns one five different adapters depending target type james david primmer wrote i've swapped out routing customprovider i'm trying use multiple adapters cp extends abstractworkspaceprovider implements workspacemanager which requires you implement getcollectionadapter requestcontext request your provider easy you just use one adapter provider you just return sample shows however what you have number workspaces adapters abstractworkspaceprovider looks like should support since i'm using routemanager i thought routemanager.resolve would handle dispatching should i abandon cp defaultprovider thanks again davep
abdera.apache.org_user_200804_22 generally i advocate approach one should write configuration write any api i.e pojos getters setters its job container take configuration map pojos i haven't had time come up more concrete proposal advocate managed classes quite yet though david primmer wrote re use framework our server environment we just need interface able pull config component entry point start all off doesn't matter what format mechanism davep tue apr 15 2008 3 29 pm david calavera david.calavera gmail.com wrote i agree i think currently better solutions than properties files spring 2.5 annotation configure stuff could good example tue apr 15 2008 11 44 pm dan diephouse dan.diephouse mulesource.com wrote i agree your conclusions i think current version little simplistic i haven't looked much i know its one my two top priority issues 1.0 properties files rarely way people want configure stuff david primmer wrote thanks dan turns out we were being brain dead we should've just used abderaservlet directly send couple init params like you have your web.xml main question i have now how use all new managed classes one area where info how wire them up help newbies like me some example properties files especially i couldn't find any src also custom routing main issue managedprovider i'm using custom provider just routing since i don't have time figure out how write properties files managedprovider since routing usually first place you'd move away from boilerplate i'd say would help have clear points factor out routing info class can loaded property managed provider managedroutemanager may also work davep tue apr 15 2008 4 46 am dan diephouse dan.diephouse mulesource.com wrote we need make sure documented fix tutorial one shouldn't have extend servlet get abdera working i guess its question what best practice best practice extend defaultprovider add your adapters supply init param your provider problem i have approach seems little overly simplistic you still need get access your backend somehow pre built adapters another story dan david primmer wrote vasu i figured out i put init params web.xml init param param name org.apache.abdera.protocol.server.provider param name param value org.apache.abdera.example.customprovider param value init param i get them from config have manager create providor override protected provider createprovider return manager.newprovider getproperties getservletconfig you leave init params out you create defaultprovider instead your customprovider davep fri apr 11 2008 2 04 pm david primmer david.primmer gmail.com wrote i'm doing server setup i thought should better documented basically i'd like make customprovider example work web.xml based setup i see some info wiki example itself uses java code compose app start jetty so i made customsampleservlet extends abderaservlet re uses other two files from custom example what does public class customsampleservlet extends abderaservlet private final static log log logfactory.getlog abderaservlet.class override protected provider createprovider return new customprovider override public void init log.debug initialing abdera servlet manager createservicemanager provider createprovider log.debug using provider provider my web.xml i have what bottom page http cwiki.apache.org confluence display abdera your first atompub server line 179 servletrequestcontext does abdera abdera provider.getabdera returns null doesn't seem right next thing i know i have null pointer exception servletrequestcontext.gethost can someone help provider bootstrap code does have something do leaving out sort thing servletholder.setinitparameter servicemanager.provider customprovider.class.getname thanks davep dan diephouse mulesource http mulesource.com http netzooid.com dan diephouse mulesource http mulesource.com http netzooid.com david calavera http www.thinkincode.net dan diephouse mulesource http mulesource.com http netzooid.com

abdera.apache.org_user_200804_25 hello all i'd like able set content entry get exactly same thing back out one case i have mind checksumming what goes out example take following string content doc abdera abdera abdera.getinstance entry entry abdera.newentry entry.setcontent content content.type.xml system.out.println entry.getcontent entry.writeto prettyxml system.out although doc went doc doc came out additionally serialization empty namespace declaration added former case i'm sure what right solution although even we're worried about preserving how elements were written out i'd prefer empty elements written out compact form default i fooled around custom writer didn't get working latter seems just being able define namespace prefix mapping atom would do trick i don't see how do presumably my output could xml version 1.0 encoding utf 8 atom:entry xmlns:atom http www.w3 org 2005 atom atom:content type application xml doc doc atom:content atom:entry element.declarens http www.w3 org 2005 atom atom only adds another namespace declaration element.getnamespaces returns unmodifiable map so go way either fyi 0.4.0 thanks eddie

abdera.apache.org_user_200804_32 you bet what it's worth i changed my maven dependency abdera 0.3.0 had same problem i am suspecting race condition some sort because analyzing line 96

abdera.apache.org_user_200712_48 i haven't read rfc 5005 we're building data service sounds somewhat similar what you're doing so i'll chime pagination along same lines what david said what we've done address pagination solution based way google has integrated opensearch its querying apis gdata implementation wise trick add monotonically increasing sequence number every entry we store which we use get very stable pagination when we pull feeds here's how works each entry written store gets next sequence number assigned entry later updated it's previous sequence number overwritten new next number we've modified our feed urls accept optional start index request parameter which lower bound sequence numbers return when more results than requested page size we add next link feed we return which feed same uri feed requested start index set one higher than highest sequence number page what guarantees you never miss any data because data changing while you read feed very important us since like you we using back end data service keep data synced across systems you only ever see same entry occur twice during feed pull fact updated during course your paginating through data which case you would want get twice maximally sync here's google's reference subject http code.google.com apis gdata reference.html case my explanation above bit fuzzy i'll give simple example how all works let's say we start off totally empty feed store colors someone posts entries red blue green yellow feed our db table stores entry meta data would look like id sequence_num red 1 blue 2 green 3 yellow 4 query we use get page results pseudo xml something like select top page_size id from meta_data where matches my feed request uri sequence_num start_index order sequence_num so someone came along pull feed http my.server data colors page size 3 would get pseudo feed xml ish feed entry id red entry entry id blue entry entry id green entry link rel next href http my.server data colors page size 3 start index 4 feed followed link http my.server data colors page size 3 start index 4 would get feed entry id yellow entry feed that's simplest case however time between when user pulled first page feed second someone had put update green posted new entry purple db table would now look like id sequence_num red 1 blue 2 green 5 green updated 5 put yellow 4 purple 6 purple inserted sequence_num 6 when user follows link http my.server data colors page size 3 start index 4 would instead get feed entry id yellow entry entry id green entry entry id purple entry feed note have now gotten green twice during same feed pull that's should because green changed between page 1 page 2 feed it's nice side effect solution works just fine matter how long you client take process page results how long you choose wait between pages whenever you request next page guaranteed simply next n significant changes after page i previously pulled where n your page size one more thing that's maybe worth noting notice i said significant changes solution hides from you any changes were superseded before you got around them which almost certainly what you want it's worth being aware after our client had pulled first page results back following things had happened put green post purple put green again db would look like id sequence_num red 1 blue 2 green 7 green updated 5 first put 7 second yellow 4 purple 6 purple inserted sequence_num 6 when user follows link http my.server data colors page size 3 start index 4 would instead get feed entry id yellow entry entry id purple entry entry id green entry feed note page one we saw inital revision green page 2 we see third revision green we never saw second again unless you're doing something pretty unusual atom feeds you probably don't care because you had gotten second you would have just overwritten third it's worth being aware what's really happening hope helps you have any more questions critiques about strategy we'd love hear them thanks bryon dec

abdera.apache.org_user_200712_49 i'll add little bit more what bryon has said we're building atomstore together 1 we've mixed together few specs bryon said we use some opensearch elements startindex totalresults itemsperpage also some paging spec elements link rel next e.g abdera extensions 2 we've also had add our own element endindex because startindex pagesize does yield enough information request next page accurately e.g one cannot assume startindex pagesize yield endindex 3 totalresults optional inexpensive produce another db query relatively useless info none our clients wanted 4 start index url param exclusive i.e db query index start index way clients can just use endindex from previous page better just use next link 5 general cursoring mechanism you first send query start index 1 max results 10 send another query start index 11 max results 10 service cannot guarantee results equivalent start index 1 max results 20 because insertions deletions could have taken place between two queries 6 note start index should interpreted any way used order entries you should never assume its value 7 we do provide link rel previous suggested paging spec we do have any practical need so synopsis we use opensearch:totalresults total number search results query necessarily all present results feed opensearch:startindex index first result opensearch:itemsperpage maximum number items appear one page foo:endindex index final result note endindex returned feed can used start index subsequent feed page request link rel next type application atom xml href specifies uri next chunk query result set chunked client must use next link when accessing next page results link contains start index max results href url btw note time definitely accurate enough here paging several items may get same time stamp due db date accuracy multi threading multi servers http wants requests against lastmodified inclusive instead exclusive which really what you're after case you may see something you've already seen has actually changed cheers chris dec 14 2007 3 30 pm bryon jacob wrote i haven't read rfc 5005 we're building data service sounds somewhat similar what you're doing so i'll chime pagination along same lines what david said what we've done address pagination solution based way google has integrated opensearch its querying apis gdata implementation wise trick add monotonically increasing sequence number every entry we store which we use get very stable pagination when we pull feeds here's how works each entry written store gets next sequence number assigned entry later updated it's previous sequence number overwritten new next number we've modified our feed urls accept optional start index request parameter which lower bound sequence numbers return when more results than requested page size we add next link feed we return which feed same uri feed requested start index set one higher than highest sequence number page what guarantees you never miss any data because data changing while you read feed very important us since like you we using back end data service keep data synced across systems you only ever see same entry occur twice during feed pull fact updated during course your paginating through data which case you would want get twice maximally sync here's google's reference subject http code.google.com apis gdata reference.html case my explanation above bit fuzzy i'll give simple example how all works let's say we start off totally empty feed store colors someone posts entries red blue green yellow feed our db table stores entry meta data would look like id sequence_num red 1 blue 2 green 3 yellow 4 query we use get page results pseudo xml something like select top page_size id from meta_data where matches my feed request uri sequence_num start_index order sequence_num so someone came along pull feed http my.server data colors page size 3 would get pseudo feed xml ish feed entry id red entry entry id blue entry entry id green entry link rel next href http my.server data colors page size 3 start index 4 feed followed link http my.server data colors page size 3 start index 4 would get feed entry id yellow entry feed that's simplest case however time between when user pulled first page feed second someone had put update green posted new entry purple db table would now look like id sequence_num red 1 blue 2 green 5 green updated 5 put yellow 4 purple 6 purple inserted sequence_num 6 when user follows link http my.server data colors page size 3 start index 4 would instead get feed entry id yellow entry entry id green entry entry id purple entry feed note have now gotten green twice during same feed pull that's should because green changed between page 1 page 2 feed it's nice side effect solution works just fine matter how long you client take process page results how long you choose wait between pages whenever you request next page guaranteed simply next n significant changes after page i previously pulled where n your page size one more thing that's maybe worth noting notice i said significant changes solution hides from you any changes were superseded before you got around them which almost certainly what you want it's worth being aware after our client had pulled first page results back following things had happened put green post purple put green again db would look like id sequence_num red 1 blue 2 green 7 green updated 5 first put 7 second yellow 4 purple 6 purple inserted sequence_num 6 when user follows link http my.server data colors page size 3 start index 4 would instead get feed entry id yellow entry entry id purple entry entry id green entry feed note page one we saw inital revision green page 2 we see third revision green we never saw second again unless you're doing something pretty unusual atom feeds you probably don't care because you had gotten second you would have just overwritten third it's worth being aware what's really happening hope helps you have any more questions critiques about strategy we'd love hear them thanks bryon dec 14 2007 2 40 pm david calavera wrote why don't you use opensearch format dec 14 2007 8 57 pm remy gendron
