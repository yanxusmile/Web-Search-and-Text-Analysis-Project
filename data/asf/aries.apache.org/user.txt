really unit testing anymore it's far too heavyweight i would mock up entitymanager instance i passed my dao bean unit test environment validate right calls made you want more complex test usually called itest integration test apache includes database i would strongly recommend using pax runner setting up osgi framework give you much better validation code actually works situ you can use real

respectively prior deploying my project osgi container i specified jdbc properties persistence.xml doesn't work very well under osgi instead one specifies what data source service use deploys bundle publishes data source service latter doesn't work well when performing unit tests out osgi my strategy so far has been maintain separate persistence descriptors different scenarios persistence.xml unit tests persistence openjpa.xml use container latter won't picked up automatically outside container can specified explicitly using meta persistence osgi it's ideal solution i'm yet sure work best

me how being able unit test my services without having startup karaf instance past i've been using spring hibernate purpose spring very flexible sense i can configure test environment my unit test still being able test services uses transactions more detail my problem follows i have dao objects containing persistence logic using jpa used my service objects contains business logic also specifies

okidokiteam.com hi bengt set up properly automated integration tests based pax exam work out box every machine which you trigger maven build pax runner started pax exam junit test setup embedded instance osgi container long you able embed all components your app inside single test either outside inside osgi container everything should work however when creating those junit based itests you'll see process developing them making them pass all machines matter how fast etc might really painful osgi container really dynamic environment you need code your tests so ready handle all timing related issues different order initialization longer usual startup time specific bundle etc you take look history aries ci build failures you'll see what i'm talking about still some phantom test failures happen every 20 builds having said i highly recommend using pax exam other guys suggested just take look itests projects attached most aries subcomponents best regards bartek 2010 9 7 bengt rodehav bengt rodehav.com tim yes i agree tests involving database really integration testing unit testing nevertheless would convenient able run them without requirement osgi container i guess reason why i hoping do because easy do past spring hibernate i try opt simplest solution maybe i'll have rethink matter i agree testing container gives more reliable result given tests easy setup run using maven i guess preferable do way.however i'm bit disillusioned past experience regarding integration testing jee containers my experience very complex error prone merely having install e g weblogic every developers workstation big hazzle past also big cost furthermore deploying starting stopping application server really doesn't work very well all result has been developers only run small subset tests since setup too complicated i'll look more detail how you handle tests aries see i can steal some your ideas thanks bengt 2010 9 7 timothy ward timothyjward hotmail.com hi bengt i would like re iterate dependency injection best way get hold entitymanager instance fact only way get container managed entitymanager point i would suggest what you should do depends your unit testing policy usually unit tests lightweight involve plenty mock objects i would suggest actually using openjpa database isn't really unit testing anymore it's far too heavyweight i would mock up entitymanager instance i passed my dao bean unit test environment validate right calls made you want more complex test usually called itest integration test apache includes database i would strongly recommend using pax runner setting up osgi framework give you much better validation code actually works situ you can use real persistence.xml regards tim date tue 7 sep 2010 09 56 17 0200 subject re unit testing from bengt rodehav.com aries user incubator.apache.org thanks your reply david i definitely have look ops4j pax runner how you use aries tests thanks advice your advice regarding dao testing also relevant i do similar way today had some problems out osgi solution interferring my osgi solution using default constructor dependency injection osgi constructor taking entity manager osgi i can probably get rid problem look same subject you bear me i forgot ask about handling data source osgi out osgi respectively prior deploying my project osgi container i specified jdbc properties persistence.xml doesn't work very well under osgi instead one specifies what data source service use deploys bundle publishes data source service latter doesn't work well when performing unit tests out osgi my strategy so far has been maintain separate persistence descriptors different scenarios persistence.xml unit tests persistence openjpa.xml use container latter won't picked up automatically outside container can specified explicitly using meta persistence osgi it's ideal solution i'm yet sure work best practice area thanks bengt 2010 9 7 david jencks sep 7 2010 12 10 am bengt rodehav wrote lots mails from me today just trying get top things i'm investigating best way deploy jpa based application osgi i've successfully used karaf ipojo combination camel before jpa seems bit more complicated using aries components jpa transaction blueprint seems provide functionality i need however one problem me how being able unit test my services without having startup karaf instance past i've been using spring hibernate purpose spring very flexible sense i can configure test environment my unit test still being able test services uses transactions more detail my problem follows i have dao objects containing persistence logic using jpa used my service objects contains business logic also specifies transaction requirements i can deploy those objects karaf using aries however i don't know how unit test those services since need presence aries i know might defined integration tests unit tests reason i would still like convenient way execute tests part my maven build preferrably without having deploy karaf possible what recommended way best practice kind tests use ops4j pax runner bunch integration tests aries use btw easy unit test dao objects either since i need get hold entity manager completely different ways depending i'm osgi environment i could take some advice subject well you code your dao objects using constructor dependency injection one arguments being emf can't you inject blueprint osgi simply supply constructor argument unit tests you do some kind service lookup your dao you tie whatever lookup technology you using service registry osgi jndi java ee hope relevant what you asking about david jencks best regards bengt

used get unmanaged jpa support however you declare your persistence units use resource_local transactions shouldn't need openjpa load any jta classes please let me know openjpa continues complain about lack jta interfaces resource_local persistence units i'll try get fixed your requirements you should need two bundles from aries jpa project aries jpa api bundle aries jpa container bundle you also need aries util bundle which jpa project uses reference jpa container bundles provide following support jpa api core interfaces used aries jpa runtime service providers jpa container core jpa

context jpa blueprint aries integration aries blueprint service providing custom namespace jpa resource injection aries jpa container loosely coupled so entirely possible pick bundles you need support you want though each piece support builds upon previous one so doesn't make much sense have managed persistence context support without managed persistence unit support there's need use blueprint declarative services perfectly capable retrieving entitymanagerfactory services from service registry how data sources discovered depends upon how configured you use jta data source non jta data source tag aries jpa container use jndi get resource registered jndi name most cases you actually want access datasource object service registry which means you need aries jndi support available

aries.apache.org_user_201009_72 hi bengt it's actually violation jpa service specification rather than jpa specification which doesn't talk about osgi all persistence unit its entities intimately related persistence unit can specify overrides entity mapping metadata defines database used very tight coupling so artefacts should live same bundle restriction further added so once bytecode weaving supported osgi possible weave entity classes classes live different bundle jpa runtime cannot guarantee weave them before first used after which time can longer woven also problem you have multiple persistence units using different jpa providers also possible entity classes woven multiple providers well might work sometimes almost certainly given you pre enhancing using single jpa provider what you doing almost certainly fine it's guaranteed portable normally way do package all managed classes single bundle defines persistence unit common structures between database tables different

aries.apache.org_user_201009_73 hi harald i said bengt earlier many significant issues around supporting entities spread across multiple bundles including limited load time enhancement sharing between multiple providers also extremely tight coupling between persistence unit its entity classes one which dpesn't tie well split between bundles i agree particularly restrictive restriction aim osgi specifications define features can used reliably portably particularly respect ordering item 3 you mention supported current model necessary import javax.persistence you only use xml definitions finally i don't think i said any point aries runtime violates jpa service specification only doesn't implement i would strongly hope we don't violate any jpa jpa service specifications future versions jpa service specification should include full support managed jpa i would like based our container regards tim from harald.wellmann multi m.de aries user incubator.apache.org date sun 19 sep 2010 18

osgi enterprise spec requires you put whole lot metadata entity classes one bundle simply cries change request after all osgi about modularity any non trivial application quite natural have entities other ingredients persistence unit spread across more than one bundle some use cases 1 common base class example mentioned bengt 2 you have core bundle some entities bundle always active two bundles b

aries.apache.org_user_201105_5 hi all i'm hitting problem reference listeners which feels like mini bug me i thought i'd see what everyone else thinks i've got bean blueprint injected reference list same bean also has reference listener when system initializing bind method called before reference list has been injected specification says reference list callbacks service proxy guaranteed available collection before bind callback invoked remain collection until after unbind callback has completed specification doesn't actually say anyone has have been told about collection which being modified so technically our behaviour within letter spec however feels like intention specification bind method called consumers service should have access collection which accurately represents final state reference list other hand relying system being particularly consistent state during initialisation obviously unwise against more general spirit osgi dynamism so maybe what we're doing perfectly reasonable what do people think code i'm using bean id thingaggregator class property name things ref thinglist bean reference list id thinglist interface thing reference listener ref thingaggregator bind method bind reference list public void bind thing thing system.out.println debug bind called things things regards holly holly cummins ibm hursley uk cumminsh uk.ibm.com unless stated otherwise above ibm united kingdom limited registered england wales number 741598 registered office po box 41 north harbour portsmouth hampshire po6 3au

aries.apache.org_user_201105_51 i think cristiano may have point aries generally follows best practice separating api implementation different bundles allows implementation replaced without changing api sharing implementations through services means can replaced dynamically without causing clients refreshed bundle cristiano missing implementation therefore would missing package import i've looked may have been missing service reference from blueprint impl bundle service provided proxy impl bundle blueprint managing bundle would complain about missing services i guess blueprint can't manage it's own service dependencies maybe note top downloads page would help anyway cristiano i'm glad you found problem regards graham 31 may 2011 03 23 johan edstrom seijoed gmail.com wrote well bundles

aries.apache.org_user_201106_16 hi some comments line broadly speaking i feel your pain i've been trying implement automated eclipselink tests long time can't get them support ee mode i'm tempted provide shim bundle aries make work regards tim date sun 12 jun 2011 15 33 55 0200 from harald.wellmann gmx.de user aries.apache.org subject osgi jpa service spec implementation mismatch looking osgi jpa service spec 4.2 two implementations aries gemini i somehow feel there's rather mismatch maybe it's just my misunderstanding so i'd glad someone could comment following assumptions 1 aries jpa container implements most jpa provider behaviour defined osgi enterprise spec central place given jpa implementation like openjpa eclipselink just needs register javax.persistence.spi.persistenceprovider implementation service registry aries do all service bundle tracking entitymanagerfactory registration behalf true however aries jpa container implementation jpa service specification aries jpa container actually supports container managed jpa which part jpa service specification means you get jta transaction integration well runtime detection load time enhancement entity classes latter two only available 4.3 compliant frameworks what you don't get any concept entitymanagerfactorybuilder jdbc tracking however we do reuse meta persistence header lot property names from jpa service specification idea lot people aries drop replacement better features original intention jpa service spec offer container style extender like aries well unmanaged style one like gemini were number missing features framework i worked get added 4.3 core spec we now trying get spec support extra features aries has point we would definitely aim implement container part jpa service spec 2 despite title jpa service specification osgi enterprise spec does really specify jpa service spec just mentions jpa providers persistence bundles client bundles all plural spec also has clear distinction between persistence provider i.e implementation jpa spec jsr 317 works java se ee has osgi support jpa provider adds osgi support vanilla persistence provider idea here jpa providers from jsr 317 can provide simple osgi service persistenceprovider implementation get osgi support rather than all needing implement duplicate osgi management code it's already pretty big job write jpa provider implement jpa spec so seemed better load them another spec implement way osgi alliance hoped most jpa providers would usable rather than just ri 3 conceivable implement com.example.myjpa osgi bundle which complies both jsr 317 osgi jpa spec bundle would track all persistence bundles datasources register entitymanagerfactory services matching persistence units yes possible do it's lot work though why extender envisaged being separate 4 all one vanilla osgi persistence provider along lines 3 would cause conflicts aries jpa because aries would try register entitymanagerfactory behalf provider whereas provider registers its own factories actually wouldn't cause conflict you allowed have multiple services service registry aries factories add extra property indicate container managed property org.apache.aries.jpa.container.managed see http aries.apache.org modules jpaproject.html more information 5 osgi enterprise java ee java se should emfs created using persistenceprovider.createcontainerentitymanagerfactory persistenceprovider.createentitymanagerfactory jsr 317 7.3.1 says within java ee environment entity manager factory may injected using persistenceunit annotation obtained through jndi lookup so osgi java se must java ee thus support persistenceunit injection which afaik currently possible aries osgi enterprise typically java ee defines jta web module standards i said my answer question 1 jpa service substantially cut down spec due missing features gemini does spec persistenceprovider.createentitymanagerfactory aries does managed persistenceprovider.createcontainerentitymanagerfactory my view aries much more useful particularly 4.3 framework because jta integration framework independent load time enhancement persistenceunit does currently work aries though moment aries blueprint supports annotations technically spec says within java ee environment which does cover osgi framework i do take your point aries persistence units persistence contexts available through dependency injection like ee using blueprint namespace you can also use jndi you like through osgi:service style lookup background all i used aries openjpa proof concept osgi jpa implementation while ago currently i'm experimenting gemini first i thought design looked rather broken compared aries tying osgi jpa provider eclipselink which really example 3 yes what did i think it's pretty sucky taking another close look osgi enterprise spec i can't say approach against spec may even closer i still do think aries design more flexible closer osgi spirit modularity dry gemini reference implementation jpa service spec so has follow i think could do better job being jpa provider independent though any rate i'm currently unable make aries jpa eclipselink work together eclipselink 2.2.0 does register persistenceprovider relying gemini jpa do so gemini also creates emfs see 4 you can use properties distinguish better yet use blueprint look up your jpa resources eclipselink 2.1.3 does register persistenceprovider which throws exception when aries invokes createcontainerentitymanagerfactory saying operation supported osgi which i think downright incorrect due ambiguity 5 so i'm stuck see https bugs.eclipse.org bugs show_bug.cgi id 252263 i tried get them fix got traction you're actually completely stuck one way round repackage extend eclipselink register org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.persistenceprovider class service registry one simple way would add fragment some blueprint xml i think bottom line making jpa implementations pluggable osgi java ee osgi jpa spec needs more specific mandating jpa container implemented aries might good idea from my answer question 1 we now trying get spec support extra features aries has i completely agree you current spec usable ri quite tied eclipselink has number missing ee features regards harald

type primitive must converted correspond ing wrapper type before any usage given beans can injected other beans cannot work factory method returns void nor abovementioned cast possible spring's methodinvokingfactorybean states note factory bean return special methodinvoker.void singleton instance when used invoke method which returns null has void return type while user factory bean presumably calling method perform some sort initialization doesn't care about any return value all factory beans must return value so special singleton instance used case while it's possible we could

aries.apache.org_user_201012_8 hi i am currently using spring spring dm my application we export spring beans using dm services consume them from other bundles i haven't used blueprint portion spring dm yet i am curious i can use aries blueprint implementation interop spring same way i am currently using spring dm ie can i use both namespaces from same xml file share beans back forth etc can aries create spring contexts each bundle out scope so do you have suggestion how maintain functionality also how mature aries does fully implement blueprint i saw recently graduated top level project grats thanks david
aries.apache.org_user_201012_9 hi david fact blueprint specification spring dm reference implementation blueprint so you can use aries blueprint exactly you use spring dm especially aries blueprint more flexible namespace than spring dm aries implements all blueprint specification mature project even versioning still 0.3 incubating it's used apache karaf apache servicemix stable release regards jb 12 28 2010 03 18 am david erickson wrote hi i am currently using spring spring dm my application we export spring beans using dm services consume them from other bundles i haven't used blueprint portion spring dm yet i am curious i can use aries blueprint implementation interop spring same way i am currently using spring dm ie can i use both namespaces from same xml file share beans back forth etc can aries create spring contexts each bundle out scope so do you have suggestion how maintain functionality also how mature aries does fully implement blueprint i saw recently graduated top level project grats thanks david
